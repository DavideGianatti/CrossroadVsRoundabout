## Crossroad vs Roundabout
This project contains C++ scripts to simulate the traffic flows through intersections with traffic lights and roundabouts. 
The goal of the simulation is to compare the time wasted by traffic in both scenarios to determine whether it is more beneficial to keep traffic lights or to replace them with a roundabout. This comparison helps in making informed decisions about traffic management and infrastructure improvements.
