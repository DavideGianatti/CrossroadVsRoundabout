## Traffic Lights vs Roundabout
This project contains C++ scripts to simulate the traffic flows through intersections with traffic lights and roundabouts. 
The goal of the simulation is to compare the time wasted by traffic in both scenarios to determine whether it is more beneficial to keep traffic lights or to replace them with a roundabout. This comparison helps in making informed decisions about traffic management and infrastructure improvements.

### Project Structure
The project is organized as follow:
- **roundabout.h**: declaration of classes and methods usefull for the simulation of a roundabout;
- **roundabout.cpp**: implementation of roundabout.h;
- **trafficlights.h**: declarations of classes and methods usefull for the simulation of a crossroad with traffic-lights;
- **trafficlights.cpp**: implementation of trafficlights.h.
